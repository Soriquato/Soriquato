Hello !! Let met introduce myself : I am Soriquato, a self learning developper. Computer Science is really something i love learning, because of all the different knowledge you can get from it. My main language is Javascript, but i also code in Python. I am looking forward to learn Typescript, C, C#, and Java, because they are essential.
